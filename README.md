## Collaboration

>The collaboration on the project first started with the architecture, which was decided and discussed in pair programming on only Samuels device.
>In the course of the project, different work packages were divided, such as database, api management, frontend and fragment communication.
>However, these are merged into each other and can therefore not be clearly assigned.
>Tendecy was, that frontend and charting was developed by Samuel, while database management and async tasking was developed by Philipp.
>However the lines are very blurry, since debugging and individual tasks in each field were done by both parties.
